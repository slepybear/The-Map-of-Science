# X / Twitter Viral Launch Drafts 🐦

On X, you have **0.5 seconds** to stop the scroll. Visuals are 80% of the battle, but the text must be punchy.

## Option 1: The "Mind-Blowing Scale" Hook (Recommended) 🔥
*Best for general audience & viral reach. Focuses on the "Wow" factor.*

**Tweet 1 (The Hook):**
> I mapped the entire history of human science in one interactive graph. 🌌
>
> From simple axioms to Quantum Mechanics.
> Trace the lineage of every major discovery.
>
> It's like a "Tech Tree" for civilization.
>
> 🧵👇 (Open Source)

**[⚠️ INSERT VIDEO HERE: Zoom from a single node like "Calculus" out to the whole galaxy view]**

**Tweet 2 (The Link):**
> We often get lost in the noise of daily tech news.
>
> I wanted to see the big picture. How does Physics connect to Biology? Where does AI fit?
>
> So I built this using React + Neo4j.
>

## Option 2: The "Developer/Tech" Hook 👨‍💻
*Best for attracting contributors and devs. Uses coding analogies.*

**Tweet 1:**
> Imagine if Reality had a `package.json`. 📦
>
> I built a dependency graph for scientific knowledge.
>
> It tracks which theories "import" others.
> e.g., `General Relativity` depends on `Riemannian Geometry`.
>
> Built with React, D3.js, and Neo4j.
> And it's fully Open Source. ⚡️
>
> [Link to GitHub]

## Option 3: The "Problem/Solution" Hook 📉
*Best for "Building in Public" engagement. Relatable struggle.*

**Tweet 1:**
> Science is moving too fast.
>
> New papers, new fields, new jargon every day. It's impossible to keep up.
>
> We need a map. 🗺️
>
> So I'm building one. An open-source interface to visualize the derivation of all human knowledge.
>
> Who wants to help me fill in the blank spots? 🙋‍♂️
>
> #OpenSource #Science #DataViz

## 💡 Vital Tips for X
1.  **THE MEDIA IS MANDATORY**: Do not post just text. You **must** attach a video (screen recording) or a high-res GIF.
    *   *Video Script Idea*: Start zoomed in on a familiar node (e.g., "Newton's Laws"), then slowly zoom out to show the massive complexity of the whole tree. This creates a "Wow" effect.
2.  **Tagging**: Tag `@ReactJS`, `@Neo4j`, or `#DataViz` in the replies, not the main tweet (keeps it clean).
3.  **The Thread**: If the first tweet gets traction, add a 3rd reply: "I'm looking for contributors! If you know React or Science, PRs are welcome: [GitHub Link]"
