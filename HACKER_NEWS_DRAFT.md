# Hacker News Launch Kit 🚀

Hacker News (HN) is the most critical platform for your project. A successful "Show HN" post can bring 10,000+ visitors in a few hours.

Here is a crafted submission strategy designed to appeal to the "intellectual hacker" audience.

## 1. The Title (Crucial)
*Choose ONE of the following. Option A is my top recommendation for this audience.*

*   **Option A (The "Dependency" Angle - Devs love this analogy):**
    `Show HN: The Map of Science – I built a "dependency graph" for human knowledge`

*   **Option B (The "Visual" Angle - Very clickable):**
    `Show HN: Interactive visualization of how scientific theories are derived`

*   **Option C (The "Grand Vision" Angle):**
    `Show HN: The Map of Science – Tracing the lineage of all scientific fields`

## 2. The URL
**Submit this link**: `https://github.com/slepybear/The-Map-of-Science`
*(Note: Linking to GitHub is better than the demo for HN, because they want to see the code and it proves it's open source. You link the demo in the comment.)*

## 3. The "Maker Comment" (The Article)
*Immediately after submitting the link, go to the comment section of your post and paste this. This is your "article" that sells the vision.*

**Body**:

Hi HN,

I’ve always felt that while science is advancing exponentially, our understanding of *where* new discoveries fit is lagging behind. We focus on the "frontier," but often lose sight of the path that got us there.

So I built **The Map of Science** to fix this.

**The Concept**
Think of it like a `package.json` for reality. Just like software libraries have dependencies, every scientific theory is built on top of previous ones. I wanted to visualize this derivation chain—allowing anyone to trace a path from basic axioms of Mathematics or Physics all the way up to modern Quantum Mechanics, CRISPR, or LLMs.

**The Tech Stack**
*   **Frontend**: React with D3.js/Cytoscape. I needed something that could handle complex, force-directed layouts without melting the browser.
*   **Backend**: Neo4j. A relational DB just couldn't handle the depth of recursive queries needed to walk the "knowledge tree," so a graph DB was the only logical choice.
*   **Data**: Currently seeded with core Physics, Math, and CS theories.

**Why Open Source?**
Mapping the entire history of human science is too big for one person. I’ve built the engine and defined the data structure, but I need domain experts (you!) to help verify the relationships and expand into Biology, Chemistry, and Social Sciences.

**I’d love your feedback on:**
1.  The visualization approach (does the tree structure make sense?).
2.  How to best represent "disputed" or "superseded" theories (like Newtonian vs. Relativistic mechanics).

Thanks for looking!

## 4. Success Tips
1.  **Timing**: Post this on a **weekday morning** (around 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM US Pacific Time). This is when HN traffic peaks.
2.  **Engage**: Stay on the page for the first hour. If someone asks "Why Neo4j?", reply with a technical answer. If someone says "This is cool", say "Thanks! What field should I add next?".
3.  **Be Humble**: HN hates marketing fluff. The tone above is written to be humble but ambitious ("I need help", "I've built the engine").
