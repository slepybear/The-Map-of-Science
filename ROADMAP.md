# The Map of Science Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for **The Map of Science**. We welcome the community to join us in achieving these goals!

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] **Core Visualization**: Interactive tree graph using D3.js/Cytoscape.js.
- [x] **Data Structure**: Neo4j graph database for storing scientific theories and relationships.
- [x] **Basic UI**: Responsive layout with zoom, pan, and search functionality.
- [x] **Docker Support**: One-click deployment with Docker Compose.
- [x] **Initial Data**: Seeding scripts for basic scientific disciplines.

## Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience (Next Steps)
- [ ] **User Accounts**: Allow users to save their learning progress and favorite nodes.
- [ ] **Multi-language UI**: Full support for English, Chinese, and other major languages.
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**: Better touch interactions for mobile devices.
- [ ] **Performance Tuning**: Optimize graph rendering for 10,000+ nodes.

## Phase 3: Community & Content Expansion
- [ ] **Crowdsourcing Platform**: Allow verified experts to contribute new theories and relationships directly via UI.
- [ ] **Citation Integration**: Link nodes to real-world academic papers (DOI integration).
- [ ] **Educational Modes**: "Time Travel" mode to see how science evolved year by year.
- [ ] **API Access**: Public API for researchers to access the knowledge graph data.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Suggest related fields based on user interest.
- [ ] **3D Visualization**: Experimental 3D view of the scientific universe.
- [ ] **Collaboration Tools**: Real-time collaborative mapping for research teams.
