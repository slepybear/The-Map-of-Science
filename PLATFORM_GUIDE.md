# Platform Launch Guide: Rules, Values & Strategy

This guide compares the major platforms for launching open-source projects. Use this to tailor your strategy for "The Map of Science".

## 🏆 Platform Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | **Product Hunt** 😸 | **Hacker News** 🍊 | **Reddit** 🤖 | **Twitter / X** 🐦 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Value** | **"New & Cool"**<br>Celebrating new products, UI/UX, and tools. | **"Intellectual Curiosity"**<br>Technical depth, minimalism, interesting ideas. | **"Community & Authenticity"**<br>Genuine discussion, no-bullshit, niche interests. | **"Building in Public"**<br>Visuals, personality, networking, hype. |
| **Eligibility** | **Account Age**: 1 week+ recommended to post.<br>**Restriction**: "Makers" can hunt their own product. | **No hard limit**, but new accounts are flagged easily.<br>**"Show HN"**: Must be your own work. | **Karma**: Many subreddits require 20-50+ Karma to post.<br>**Age**: Accounts < 1 week often auto-banned. | **None**. But new accounts with 0 followers have low reach. |
| **Frequency Limit** | **Strict**: Once per product life-cycle.<br>• Can repost only for major updates (e.g., v2.0) after 6 months.<br>• No daily/weekly spam. | **Soft but Brutal**: Don't repost the same link.<br>• If it fails, wait months or change the URL/Angle significantly.<br>• Reposting = Spam ban. | **Medium**: Once per subreddit.<br>• Don't cross-post to 10 subs at once (looks like a bot).<br>• Respect "Self-Promo" days. | **Unlimited**.<br>• Daily updates are encouraged.<br>• Reposting the same tweet is bad; repurposing content is good. |
| **Content Strategy** | **Polished**: High-res screenshots, animated GIFs, enthusiastic "Maker Comment". | **Raw & Technical**: Plain text title. Link to GitHub/Demo. Comment explaining "How it works". | **Storytelling**: "I quit my job to build this..." or "I felt lost in science so I made..."<br>• **Reply to everyone**. | **Visual Hook**: 15s video/GIF is mandatory.<br>• Use threads (🧵) for details.<br>• Tags: #OpenSource #DataViz |
| **Golden Rule** | **Do NOT ask for upvotes**.<br>Asking for feedback is okay. Asking for votes gets you delisted. | **No Marketing Fluff**.<br>Avoid words like "Revolutionary", "Best", "AI-powered". Be humble. | **1:10 Ratio**.<br>For every 1 self-promo post, make 10 helpful comments in the community. | **Engage**.<br>Don't just broadcast. Reply to big accounts, quote-tweet relevant news. |
| **Best Time** | **12:01 AM PST** (San Francisco time).<br>The "day" cycle starts then. | **Weekday Mornings** (8-10 AM PST).<br>Avoid weekends (low traffic, though easier to front-page). | **Weekday Mornings** (US time).<br>Varies by subreddit. Check their sidebar. | **Anytime**, but US mornings are peak for tech Twitter. |
| **Taboos** | • Linking directly to the upvote page.<br>• Spamming DMs to ask for support. | • Paywalls.<br>• "Hello World" level trivial projects.<br>• URL shorteners. | • "Dump and Run" (posting and never replying).<br>• Using marketing-speak title. | • Hashtag spamming (more than 3-4 is bad).<br>• Boring text-only tweets. |

## 🔍 Deep Dive by Platform

### 1. Product Hunt (PH)
*   **The "Launch Day"**: On PH, you have **24 hours** to shine. The leaderboard resets every day at 12:01 AM PST.
*   **The "Maker Comment"**: As soon as you post, write a comment introducing yourself.
    *   *Template*: "Hi Hunters! 👋 I'm [Name]. I built The Map of Science because..."
*   **Images**: You need a 240x240 logo and a few 1270x760 gallery images. **GIFs work best**.

### 2. Hacker News (HN)
*   **The "Show HN" Tag**: Your title MUST start with `Show HN:`.
    *   *Good*: `Show HN: The Map of Science – Interactive visualization of knowledge`
    *   *Bad*: `The Map of Science is the best way to learn!`
*   **The First Comment**: Explain the technical stack (Neo4j + React). HN users love implementation details.
*   **Brutal Honesty**: Expect critical feedback. Don't take it personally; they critique the code/idea, not you.

### 3. Reddit
*   **Subreddit Culture**:
    *   `r/reactjs`: Show your code, talk about performance (e.g., "How I rendered 10k nodes").
    *   `r/dataisbeautiful`: **Must** include a comment with "Source" (where data came from) and "Tools" (what you used to build it). Strict rules on visuals.
    *   `r/webdev`: Focus on the dev journey.
*   **Self-Promotion**: Check the sidebar rules of EACH subreddit before posting. Some only allow "Showoff Saturday".

### 4. Twitter / X
*   **The "Build in Public" Movement**: You don't just launch once. You launch every feature.
    *   *Day 1*: "I added a timeline view!" (Video)
    *   *Day 2*: "Fixed a bug with Neo4j indexing." (Screenshot of code)
*   **Tags**: Use #buildinpublic, #indiehacker, #javascript.
