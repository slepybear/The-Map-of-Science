# Promotion Kit for "The Map of Science"

Here are the draft posts for various platforms. You can copy and paste these directly to promote your project.

## 1. Hacker News (Show HN)
**Target**: https://news.ycombinator.com/submit
**Title**: `Show HN: The Map of Science – Interactive visualization of all human knowledge`
**Url**: `https://github.com/slepybear/The-Map-of-Science` (or your Vercel link if you prefer: `https://build-five-dun.vercel.app/map`)
**Text** (Optional comment):
> Hi HN,
>
> I built this interactive visualization to help people understand how different scientific fields are connected and derived from one another.
>
> In an era of rapid technological explosion, it's easy to get lost. My goal is to let anyone trace the lineage of a cutting-edge theory back to its roots.
>
> Tech stack: React + D3.js/Cytoscape + Neo4j.
>
> The project is open source and I'd love your feedback on the data structure and visualization approach!

## 2. Reddit
**Target Subreddits**: `r/reactjs`, `r/webdev`, `r/dataisbeautiful`, `r/opensource`, `r/InternetIsBeautiful`

**Title**: `I built an interactive "Map of Science" to visualize how human knowledge evolves (Open Source)`

**Body**:
> Hi everyone,
>
> I've always felt that while science is advancing rapidly, it's hard for the general public to understand where new discoveries fit in the bigger picture. So I built **The Map of Science**.
>
> **Live Demo**: https://build-five-dun.vercel.app/map
> **GitHub**: https://github.com/slepybear/The-Map-of-Science
>
> **What it does:**
> *   Visualizes scientific theories as an interactive tree.
> *   Shows the derivation chain: see how Physics leads to Chemistry, and how basic principles lead to frontier tech.
> *   Built with React, D3.js, and Neo4j.
>
> I'm looking for contributors to help expand the dataset and improve the visualization. Let me know what you think!

## 3. Twitter / X
**Draft 1 (Visual focus)**:
> 🌌 Just launched "The Map of Science" – an interactive way to explore all human knowledge.

## 4. Product Hunt
**Name**: `The Map of Science`
**Tagline**: `Interactive visualization of the evolution of human knowledge`
**Description**:
> An open-source interactive platform that visualizes scientific theories in a dynamic tree. It helps users understand the derivation chains of knowledge, bridging the gap between basic principles and cutting-edge frontiers. Perfect for students, researchers, and science enthusiasts.

## 5. Tips for Posting
*   **Images/Video**: ALWAYS attach a screenshot or a short screen recording (GIF) of the map being zoomed/panned. Visuals get 10x more engagement.
*   **Timing**:
    *   **Hacker News**: Weekdays morning (9 AM - 12 PM PT) are best.
    *   **Reddit**: Similar to HN, avoid weekends for serious tech subreddits.
*   **Engage**: Reply to every comment you get!
