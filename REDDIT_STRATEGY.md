# Reddit Launch Strategy: Finding Your Tribe 🤖

Reddit is not one platform; it's thousands of tiny, passionate communities. To succeed, you must tailor your message to each "Subreddit".

Here is your battle plan for **The Map of Science**.

## 1. The "Big Three" Communities (High Traffic)

### 🎯 r/dataisbeautiful (19M+ Members)
*   **Why**: This is the "Holy Grail" for visualization projects. A top post here can bring 50k+ visitors.
*   **The Strategy**: Visuals first.
    *   **Post Type**: `Image/Video` (Required). Do not post a text link.
    *   **Title**: `[OC] I built an interactive map of all human scientific knowledge, tracing the derivation from axioms to modern frontiers.`
    *   **First Comment (Mandatory)**: You MUST post a comment immediately with:
        *   **Source**: "Data compiled from Wikidata and academic textbooks."
        *   **Tools**: "Built with React, D3.js, and Neo4j."
        *   **Link**: "Interactive version here: [Link]"
*   **Warning**: They are strict about the `[OC]` tag (Original Content). Make sure your visualization looks polished.

### 🎯 r/InternetIsBeautiful (16M+ Members)
*   **Why**: For "cool tools" that are fun to explore.
*   **The Strategy**: Focus on the "Experience".
    *   **Title**: `I made a website that lets you trace the lineage of any scientific theory back to its roots.`
    *   **Body**: Keep it simple. "I always wanted to see how Physics connects to Biology..."

### 🎯 r/reactjs (380k+ Members)
*   **Why**: To find **Contributors** (Devs who can help you build).
*   **The Strategy**: Focus on the "Tech Stack".
    *   **Title**: `I built a massive force-directed graph (Neo4j + D3) to map science. Looking for open-source contributors!`
    *   **Body**: Talk about the challenges of rendering 1000+ nodes, state management, and why you chose a Graph DB.

## 2. The "Niche" Communities (High Engagement)
*These are smaller, but the users are your true "Soulmates" who will care deeply.*

### 🧠 r/AskScience & r/Physics & r/math
*   **Strategy**: Don't "promote". Ask for **Feedback**.
    *   **Title**: `I'm building a dependency tree of Physics theories. Does this derivation of Quantum Mechanics look right to you?`
    *   **Why it works**: Experts love correcting people. By asking if it's "right", you get them to look closely. If they like it, they will become your best advocates.

### 🎓 r/SelfTaught & r/learnprogramming
*   **Strategy**: The "Inspiration" angle.
    *   **Title**: `I taught myself React to build my dream project: A map of all science.`
    *   **Body**: Share your learning journey. People love an underdog story.

## 3. How to Find "Your People" (Soulmates)

*   **Search for Keywords**: Go to Reddit search and type `knowledge graph`, `learning path`, `visualizing science`.
*   **Look for "Help Wanted"**: Find posts where people ask "How do I learn Physics from scratch?".
    *   **Reply**: "I'm actually building a tool for exactly this! It maps the prerequisites for every theory. Check it out: [Link]"
    *   *This is high-value, non-spammy promotion.*

## 4. The "Golden Rules" of Reddit

1.  **The 10% Rule**: Reddit hates marketers. For every 1 post about your project, try to make 9 comments on other people's posts. Be a human, not a bot.
2.  **Reply to EVERYONE**: If someone says "Cool!", reply "Thanks! What's your favorite field of science?". This boosts the algorithm.
3.  **Timing Matters**: Post around **8:00 AM - 10:00 AM US Eastern Time** (Mon-Thu). This catches both US morning coffee and EU afternoon breaks.

## 5. Draft for r/dataisbeautiful (Copy-Paste)

**Title**: `[OC] Interactive Map of Science: Tracing the lineage of theories from 1600 to 2024`

**First Comment**:
> **Source**: Aggregated from academic curriculums and Wikidata.
> **Tools**: React, D3.js, Neo4j, Cytoscape.
>
> **Why I made this**:
> I wanted to visualize science as a "dependency tree" (like software). You can zoom in to see how Newtonian Physics derives into Fluid Dynamics, or how Logic derives into Computer Science.
>
> **Live Interactive Map**: https://build-five-dun.vercel.app/map
> **Open Source Repo**: https://github.com/slepybear/The-Map-of-Science
>
> Feedback on the visualization layout is welcome!
